# Adult Income Classification

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## 🔍 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts income categories (`<=50K` or `>50K`) using demographic and work-related features from the UCI Adult dataset.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is the [ Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult), which contains attributes like age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, hours-per-week, etc.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
5. Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## 📈 Results
Achieved reasonable classification accuracy using different models. Precision and recall metrics were also analyzed to evaluate model performance fairly.
